# Scientific Computing for Chemists (My Learning Journey)

This repository contains my progress, solutions, and notes while actively working through the excellent [Charles Weiss's Scientific Computing for Chemists textbook and repository](https://github.com/weisscharlesj/SciCompforChemists). This is a key part of my personal Python upskilling plan for my pharmaceutical chemistry degree and future placement year.

## Goals

- **Strengthen Python fundamentals** within a practical chemical context.
- **Apply computational skills** to real-world chemical data analysis and simulations.
- **Build a public record** of my learning process, problem-solving abilities, and code development.
- **Prepare for advanced topics** in computational chemistry relevant to pharmaceutical research.

## Tools & Technologies Used

-   **Python:** The core programming language for all computational tasks.
-   **Jupyter Notebooks:** For interactive coding, analysis, and combining code with explanations and visualizations.
-   **VS Code:** My primary integrated development environment.
-   **GitHub Desktop:** For managing Git version control and syncing changes.

### Will use in later Chapters
-   **NumPy:** Essential for numerical operations and array manipulation in scientific computing.
-   **Matplotlib:** For creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations of data.
-   **SciPy:** A library of scientific and technical computing routines, including integration (`quad`), optimization, and more.
-   **RDKit:** A cheminformatics toolkit for molecular manipulation, analysis, and visualization.
