# Scientific Computing for Chemists (My Learning Journey)

This repository contains my progress, solutions, and notes while actively working through the excellent [Charles Weiss's Scientific Computing for Chemists textbook and repository](https://github.com/weisscharlesj/SciCompforChemists). This is a key part of my personal Python upskilling plan for my pharmaceutical chemistry degree and placement year.

## Tools & Technologies Used

-   **Python:** The core programming language for all computational tasks.
-   **Jupyter Notebooks:** For interactive coding, analysis, and combining code with explanations and visualizations.
-   **VS Code:** My primary integrated development environment.
-   **GitHub Desktop:** For managing Git version control and syncing changes.
-   **AI Assistance:** Used as a learning aid, debugging assistance, and explaining complex concepts.

### Will use in later Chapters
-   **NumPy:** Essential for numerical operations and array manipulation in scientific computing.
-   **Matplotlib:** For creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations of data.
-   **SciPy:** A library of scientific and technical computing routines, including integration (`quad`), optimization, and more.
-   **RDKit:** A cheminformatics toolkit for molecular manipulation, analysis, and visualization.

## My Strategic Learning Plan: Solid State Analytical Chemistry Focus

This plan prioritizes my study of the "Scientific Computing for Chemists" textbook, focusing on building skills most relevant to my degree and upcoming Solid State Analytical Chemistry placement.

---

### Phase 1: Python Foundations

* **Chapters:** 0, 1, 2
* **Why:** Establishes core Python syntax and intermediate concepts essential for efficient coding in all subsequent chapters.

---

### Phase 2: Core Data Analysis Toolkit (ESSENTIAL)

* **Chapters:** 3, 4, 5
* **Why:** These are the universal tools for scientific data.
    * **Matplotlib (Ch 3):** Plotting all types of analytical data.
    * **NumPy (Ch 4):** Efficient numerical operations on data arrays.
    * **Pandas (Ch 5):** Handling and analyzing structured (tabular) experimental data.

---

### Phase 3: Key Analytical Applications & Chemometrics

* **Chapters:** 6, 8, 10, 11, 12, 14, 15
* **Why:** Direct application of core skills to chemical challenges:
    * **Signal & Noise (Ch 6):** Critical for processing raw analytical signals.
    * **Mathematics (Ch 8) / Optimization (Ch 14):** For data fitting, modeling, and parameter optimization.
    * **Plotting with Seaborn (Ch 10):** Professional visualization of analytical results.
    * **NMR (Ch 11):** Vital if solid-state NMR is part of your placement's characterization methods.
    * **Machine Learning (Ch 12):** Essential for chemometrics, classification, and predictive analysis of analytical data.
    * **Cheminformatics (Ch 15):** For computational understanding of molecular structures.

---

### Phase 4: Supplemental & General Skills

* **2s:** 7, 9, 13, 16
* **Why:** Valuable but less immediately central to core solid-state analytical tasks. To be explored as time and specific placement needs allow.
    * (Image Processing, Simulations, Command Line, Bioinformatics)
