# Scientific Computing for Chemists

Working through [Charles Weiss's Scientific Computing for Chemists](https://weisscharlesj.github.io/SciCompforChemists/) as part of my Python upskilling plan.

## Goals

- Strengthen Python fundamentals in a chemical context
- Apply skills to real-world data and simulations
- Build a public record of learning & problem solving

## Tools Used

- Python
- Jupyter Notebooks
- NumPy, Matplotlib, SciPy, RDKit (eventually)
